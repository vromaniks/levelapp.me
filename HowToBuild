How to Build for Android
------------------------

Prerequisites:

1. Android SDK >= 10

2. Apache Ant >= 1.7.0

To build:

1. Create 'local.properties' file containing sdk.dir:
	sdk.dir=<path to the Android SDK folder>
E.g., on my computer 'local.properties' consists of line:
  sdk.dir=home/bac1ca/programming/android-sdk-linux_86

2. In command line: 'ant debug' (or 'ant release' for getting release version)

3. Sign your package manually.
